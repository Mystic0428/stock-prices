# Stock Prices

Fetches accurate US stock data from Yahoo Finance. Use this instead of answering from memory — model knowledge of stock prices is always stale.

## When to Use

- Any question about a US stock's current price, change, or volume
- Company fundamentals: market cap, P/E, EPS, dividend yield, 52-week range
- Historical price data, candlestick/OHLCV bars, returns over a period
- Multiple tickers in one question (batch quote)

**Do NOT answer stock price questions from memory.** Always call this skill.

## Setup (first run only)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `.venv/` already exists, skip this step.

## Usage

All commands output JSON. Parse and present to the user in a readable form.
Always use `.venv/bin/python` so the right yfinance is loaded.

### Quote — current price (most common)

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/stock.py quote AAPL
.venv/bin/python scripts/stock.py quote AAPL MSFT GOOGL    # batch
```

Returns: `price`, `change`, `change_pct`, `volume`, `day_high`, `day_low`, `prev_close`, `market_cap`, `currency`, `timestamp`.

### Info — company details and financial metrics

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/stock.py info AAPL
```

Returns: name, sector, industry, P/E, EPS, dividend, beta, 52-week high/low, margins, revenue, business summary, etc.

### History — OHLCV bars

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/stock.py history AAPL --period 1mo
.venv/bin/python scripts/stock.py history AAPL --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-05-01 --interval 1d
```

Period: `1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max`
Interval: `1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d, 1wk, 1mo`

## Output Interpretation

- `change_pct` is already a percentage (e.g. `1.18` means +1.18%). Do not multiply by 100.
- `timestamp` is in US Eastern time (market timezone). Mention the timezone when reporting to the user.
- `market_cap`, `volume`, `revenue` are raw numbers — format with thousands separators or B/M suffix for readability.
- If the response is `{"ticker": "X", "error": "..."}`, tell the user the specific reason (invalid ticker, network issue, etc.) instead of making up a price.

## Common Pitfalls

- yfinance is unofficial. If you see repeated rate-limit errors, wait a minute and retry — don't spam.
- For non-US tickers (e.g. Taiwan `2330.TW`, Hong Kong `0700.HK`), the same commands work but mention the exchange suffix.
- Pre-market / after-hours prices are NOT included in `quote`. The `price` is the last regular session close.
